Task:

You have to write a program in C++ that can be used to sell ice cream.

Initial Situation:

You have a 5 euro note and want to buy ice cream for yourself and your two friends.

The following types of ice cream are available:

    Capri: €1.10
    Nogger: €1.60
    Cornetto: €2.30

Create a program that covers the following situation:

First, the list of the different types of ice cream is displayed and you will be asked to place an ice cream order. The orders are read in using "cin".

This process is repeated until you have placed all your orders. Your two friends are allowed to choose the ice cream first.

With the remaining money you can choose an ice cream for yourself. But it could also be that you have to refrain from buying some ice cream for yourself.

Finally, the total amount as well as the change is calculated and displayed on the screen in euros and cents.

Use comments in the source code to document your program.
